#  Linear Discriminant Analysis for Machine Learning

Linear Discriminant Analysis or LDA is a dimensionality reduction technique. It is used as a pre-processing step in Machine Learning and applications of pattern classification. The goal of LDA is to project the features in higher dimensional space onto a lower-dimensional space in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality and also reduce resources and dimensional costs.

The original technique was developed in the year 1936 by Ronald A. Fisher and was named Linear Discriminant or Fisher's Discriminant Analysis. The original Linear Discriminant was described as a two-class technique. The multi-class version was later generalized by C.R Rao as Multiple Discriminant Analysis. They are all simply referred to as the Linear Discriminant Analysis.

LDA is a supervised classification technique that is considered a part of crafting competitive machine learning models. This category of dimensionality reduction is used in areas like image recognition and predictive analysis in marketing.
